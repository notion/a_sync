def to_async(blocking_func: AnyCallable) -> AnyCallable:

    Convert a blocking function to an async function.

    Args:
        blocking_func - a blocking function

    Returns:
        async_func - an awaitable function

    If the argument is already a coroutine function, it is returned unchanged.

    If the argument is a partial which wraps a coroutine function, it is returned
    unchanged.

    The blocking function is made into an awaitable by wrapping its call inside
    an awaitable function.

    On the assumption that a blocking function is long-running, and that an
    async caller wants to run other things concurrently, the blocking function
    is called from the running loop's thread/process executor, which means
    it runs in a thread.  This allows concurrent running, but introduces possible
    thread-safety issues, which the caller should be aware of.

    XXX - what if the loop isn't running?  We could be in someone else's loop
    space, like the curio kernel.  The 'run_in_executor' function returns a
    coroutine, so it shouldn't matter.

    XXX - possible new function - 'to_concurrent', which does the thread. Update
    this to 'to_awaitable', which just wraps in an awaitable.

    XXX - or, 'to_awaitable' for awaitable wrapping, 'to_concurrent' for thread,
    and 'to_parallel' for multiprocess?  Too much?  Wait for a need?  Want to not
    break code if we add these later, so the current version should probably be
    renamed to 'to_concurrent'.
